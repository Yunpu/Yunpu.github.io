I received a master’s degree in high-energy physics from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of München in 2016. In the same year, I joined Siemens as a Ph.D. student of computer science under the supervision of Volker Tresp. My current research is primarily centered on different topics of the relational database. One topic in collaboration with Prof. Tresp is the cognitive perspective of sematic and episodic knowledge graphs. I have also been working on quantum algorithms, which can potentially accelerate the inference on semantic knowledge graphs.

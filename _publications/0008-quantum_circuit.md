In this work, the first quantum Ans Ìˆatze for the statistical relational learning onknowledge graphs using parametric quantum circuits are proposed. Twotypes of variational quantum circuits for knowledge graph embedding areintroduced. Inspired by the classical representation learning, latent featuresfor entities are first considered as coefficients of quantum states, whilepredicates are characterized by parametric gates acting on the quantumstates. For the first model, the quantum advantages disappear when it comesto the optimization of this model. Therefore, a second quantum circuit modelis introduced where embeddings of entities are generated from parameterizedquantum gates acting on the pure quantum state. The benefit of the secondmethod is that the quantum embeddings can be trained efficiently meanwhilepreserving the quantum advantages. It is shown that the proposed methodscan achieve comparable results to the state-of-the-art classical models, forexample, RESCAL, DistMult. Furthermore, after optimizing the models, thecomplexity of inductive inference on the knowledge graphs might be reducedwith respect to the number of entities.

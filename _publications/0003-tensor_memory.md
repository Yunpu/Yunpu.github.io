We discuss memory models which are based on tensor decompositions using latent representations of entities and events. We show how episodic memory and semantic memory can be realized and discuss how new memory traces can be generated from sensory input: Existing memories are the basis for perception and new memories are generated via perception. We relate our mathematical approach to the hippocampal memory indexing theory. We describe the first detailed mathematical models for the complete processing pipeline from sensory input and its semantic decoding, i.e., perception, to the formation of episodic and semantic memories and their declarative semantic decodings. Our main hypothesis is that perception includes an active semantic decoding process, which relies on latent representations of entities and predicates, and that episodic and semantic memories depend on the same decoding process. We contribute to the debate between the leading memory consolidation theories, i.e., the standard consolidation theory (SCT) and the multiple trace theory (MTT). The latter is closely related to the complementary learning systems (CLS) framework. In particular, we show explicitly how episodic memory can teach the neocortex to form a semantic memory, which is a core issue in MTT and CLS.
